•Preemptive scheduling:  Understand the fundamentals of preemptive schedul-ing.
•Race condition:  Explain how preemptive scheduling may cause race conditionsto occur.
•Mutual Exclusion:  List the necessary conditions for a satisfactory solution tomutual exclusion.
•Mutual exclusion mechanisms:  Explain how to achieve mutual exclusion usingspecialized machine instructions, locks, and semaphores.
•Semaphore:  Define  a  semaphore  and  explain  and  its  advantages  and  disad-vantages.
•Monitor:  Define a monitor and explain and its advantages and disadvantages.
